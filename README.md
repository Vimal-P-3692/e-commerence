# React Based E-Commerence Website
  This is a simple React-based web application developed for a single departmental store.  
  The store owner manages product data through an **Excel sheet**, and the website automatically updates the displayed items whenever the Excel file changes.  
  When a customer places an order, the details are sent directly to the store owner’s **WhatsApp number** — making it easy to manage orders without any complex backend or     database.
